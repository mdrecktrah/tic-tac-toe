# Tic-Tac-Toe

Welcome to my version of the classic "Tic-Tac-Toe" game!

This repo is based on a project I worked on during my Data Analytics Bootcamp at neuefische. During a rerun I decided to set up a new public repo for this in order to populate my account a bit ;) I can't say how far development will go, but for now this is just supposed to be a simple, yet working version which can be run in your terminal.

## How to start the game
In order to start a game, simply download the *tic-tac-toe.py* file and start up your terminal. In your terminal, navigate to the folder where you saved the .py file and run the command `python tic_tac_toe.py`.<br>
Tested with Python 3.9.17 and 3.11.4.

## Rules
After starting the program, you will be greeted and are prompted to enter names for Player 1 (mark "O") and Player 2 (mark "X"). The rules of the game are simple:
- The players take turns setting their marks in a 3x3 grid. Selection via entering of numbers from 1 to 9 (grid numbered from upper left to lower right).
- The goal is to get 3 marks in a row, either horizontally, vertically or diagonally.
- Every spot can only be taken once and can not be overwritten.
- Whenever no player can reach the goal, a draw will be called.
